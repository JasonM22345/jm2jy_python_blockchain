# jm2jy_python_blockchain
Python 3 blockchain implementation. Create, validate blocks. Blocks in "jm2jy_Blockchain" folder. Continuous execution. Chain validation checks for hash integrity. Use `python3 Ass4.py`.


Blockchain Implementation in Python 3
This Python 3 code implements a basic blockchain system. Key features include:

Block Creation: Generate blocks and store them in the "jm2jy_Blockchain" folder.
Continuous Execution: The program runs indefinitely, allowing users to perform blockchain operations continuously.
Chain Validation: The code verifies the integrity of the blockchain by checking the hash consistency of each block.
How to Use
Execute the program using python3 Ass4.py.
Choose from the following options in the menu:
Create New Block
Add Transaction
Validate Chain
Exit
Folder Structure
All generated block files are stored in the "jm2jy_Blockchain" folder.

Note
The indexing of block numbers starts from 1.
If the chain is invalid at block n, it means the hash of block n-1 is different from the one stored in block n.
